The material here has been developed in the repository now at
https://gitlab.fit.nasa.gov/jgbaker/tessslb.git

This is a selection of material written (at least so far) by
John G Baker (NASA-GSFC) and under the MIT license, relocated
to https://github.com/JohnGBaker/tess-short-binaries.git
to facilitate collaboration.

Other material from the same repository may be transferred later
as becomes useful.  The code here may not be useful without
access to other (not necessarily public) repositories.
